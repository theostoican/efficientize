# efficientize
> Do you often find yourself at the end of the day wondering how the time passed by so fast ? Many people struggle with this kind of feeling and they desperately try to remember how much time they really spent working and how much time recreating. I am one such example. If you are too and want to gain some insight in your everyday activity at the computer (especially if you are a computer progammer), you've arrived at the right place.

**efficientize** is an app that helps you visualize your daily activity in a more accurate way without any personal biases that people usually have when they start analyzing their performance. But, no more words, and let us see how it works.

The app is accessible in the browser and provides a Home page, from which you can access the relevant information for multiple dates.

If you click on the blue text, you will open a timeline-like visualization tool, that helps you visualize, for each hour recorded during the day how much time you spent having a particular app open and how many keystrokes you have pressed. The timeline information preserves the original order in which you have worked during the day and displays it in small bars along the x axis. On the y axis, you have 4 **categories** that show you how much you typed while having that app open. Hovering over the timeline displays more intimate information (the *name* of the app, the exact *interval* and the *frequency of keystrokes*).

From the top-left side of the timeline interface (and from the home page as well), you can access another type of visualization. Clicking the *Show stats* button leads you to the following, more statistically relevant page:
